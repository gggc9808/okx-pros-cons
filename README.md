- Discounts on trading fees

## OKX Exchange KYC Verification Requirements

On OKX, you can use a phone number or email address to create an account, but after doing so, know that this platform has 4 different account verification levels. (Higher levels give you access to a higher number of features)

**Unverified** â€“ Accounts without verification are limited and, among other things, can only withdraw 10 BTC per day.

**Level One** â€“ You must enter your nationality, name, and submit an identity document, and the withdrawal limit will increase to 200 BTC per day.

**Level Two** â€“ This verification step requires you to verify your identity with a photograph and will increase the withdrawal limit to 500 BTC per day.

**Level Three** â€“ This verification level requires you to read and accept OKX's disclaimer from the mobile app (or website) after the 2 previous steps. You'll have the same daily BTC withdrawal limit as Level Two, but the cumulative P2P transaction limit will increase to $100,000.

For almost all exchanges, trading fees are 0.1% for makers and 0.08% for takers. However, if you're a VIP user (monthly trading volume over $10 million USD), fees will start at 0.06%. Remember, however, that the amount of your OKB holdings will affect fees.

Volume discounts are granted to more active users with a minimum 30-day trading volume of $10 million USD:
